# Projects
Here is a quick collection of some of the milestone projects I have worked on throughout my college career. The projects are C++ for Unreal Engine and C# for Unity. The game name header links to a page with more details about that particular title. Details pages have a link to the code repo as well. Under each project is a video demonstrating some of the game.

## [Dragoon](https://scuhooper.github.io/Dragoon) - In Development
### Made with Unreal Engine 4
_Dragoon_ is a project which I am currently working on as a capstone project. While the name of the repo is _Dragoon_, the game currently being made with the work is titled _Cyberpunk'd_ and puts the player as a newly created anti-virus inside of a server seeking to regain control of root. The game is a third-person perspective action game focusing on sword combat in a similar vein as _Assassin's Creed_, _The Witcher_, and _Dynasty Warriors_.

The major mechanics I have implemented into the game is my take on a solution to the kung fu circle (where enemies surround the player but only ever attack one at a time), a directional grid based attack system where the player can choose the direction of their attacks like _Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy_, and a prediction system using N-grams to analyze patterns in attacks from history and attempt to predict what the player will do next.

## [Blocksplosion](https://scuhooper.github.io/Blocksplosion)
### Made with Unity
_Blocksplosion_ is an Android game where a row of blocks is added each round that continuously require more hits to destroy. The player can shoot a string of balls on their chosen path to hit as many blocks as possible and collect the pickups that give them more balls for the next round. The game is a result of an attempt to create a simple working mobile game over Spring Break. 

- Coming soon to the Google Play Store! Link will be provided once it is live!

## [Hobo Hotbox Soccer](https://scuhooper.github.io/gaming2D)
### Made with Unity
This is a group project made for a class. It is 2D version of something like _Rocket League_. Not all code in this project is mine, but all code worked on by me is marked with either my name around the functions or listed in the .cs file's header. For the project, I worked to implement customizable controls for two players on the same computer, the power-up effects of the various drug pickups, making the pause menu, and getting the correct configuration working for the scoreboard and game win condition.

## [Bex](https://scuhooper.github.io/Bex)
### Made with Unity
_Bex_ is a 2D platformer in the veins of _Mega Man_ and _Metroid_. You take control of an employee running for her life from a warehouse that has been struck by lightning which turned the forklifts and vending machines in the building into murderous robots seeking to eliminate the player. The game has mechanics for shooting, melee attacks, dashing, and being able to use destroyed vending machines as ledges to reach new heights.

## [Viscountess](https://scuhooper.github.io/Viscountess)
### Made with Unity
_The Viscountess_ is the first game I made. It is a simple 2D side scrolling, shoot-â€˜em-up where the player controls a starship called _The Viscountess_ and destroys endless waves of enemy ships until colliding with one. The player can also collect Missiles which are able to destroy ships in one hit. It is reminiscent of _Galaga_.
